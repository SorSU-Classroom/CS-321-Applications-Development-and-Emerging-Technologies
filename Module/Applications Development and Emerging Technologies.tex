\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Application}

An \textbf{application} is a software program that allows users to perform
specific tasks. Applications for desktop or laptop computers are sometimes
called \textbf{desktop applications}, while those for mobile devices are called
\textbf{mobile apps}. When you open an application, it runs inside the
operating system until you close it. Most of the time, you will have more than
one application open at the same time, which is known as \textbf{multitasking}.

\subsection{Development}

\textbf{Development} is the process of creating a software application.
It includes designing the user interface, writing code, and testing
the application for bugs. The goal of software development is to
create a program that is easy to use and works correctly.

\subsection{Application Development}

\textbf{Application development} is the process of planning, designing,
creating, testing, and deploying an application to perform various
business operations. It can be done by massive organizations with large
teams working on projects or by a single freelance developer.

% \section{Software Development Life Cycle}

% The \textbf{software development life cycle} (SDLC) is a process used by
% software developers to design, develop, and test software applications.
% The SDLC consists of several phases, including planning, analysis, design,
% implementation, and maintenance.

% \subsection{Different Types of Software Development Life Cycle Models}

% There are several different types of software development life cycle models,
% including:

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Waterfall Model
%   \item Agile Model
%   \item Spiral Model
%   \item V-Model
%   \item Iterative Model
% \end{itemize}

% \subsubsection{Waterfall Model}

% The \textbf{waterfall model} is a linear and sequential approach to software
% development. It consists of several phases, including requirements gathering,
% analysis, design, coding/implementation, testing, and maintenance. Each phase
% must be completed before moving on to the next phase.

% % Image from ./assets/sdlc/waterfall.png
% \begin{figure}[H]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./assets/sdlc/waterfall.png}
%   \caption{Waterfall Model}
%   \label{fig:waterfall}
% \end{figure}

% Figure \ref{fig:waterfall} shows the waterfall model.

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \textbf{Requirements Gathering:} In this phase, the requirements
%   for the software application are gathered from the client or end-users.
%   This phase answers the question, "What does the customer want?".

%   \item \textbf{Analysis:} In this phase, the requirements gathered in the
%   previous phase are analyzed to determine the feasibility of the project.
%   This phase answers the question, "What is the best way to achieve the
%   customer's requirements?".

%   \item \textbf{Design:} In this phase, the software application is
%   designed based on the requirements gathered in the previous phases.
%   This phase answers the question, "How will the software application
%   look and function?".

%   \item \textbf{Coding/Implementation:} In this phase, the software
%   application is developed based on the design created in the previous
%   phase. This phase answers the question, "How will the software
%   application be built?".

%   \item \textbf{Testing:} In this phase, the software application is
%   tested to ensure that it works correctly and meets the requirements
%   specified by the client or end-users. This phase answers the question,
%   "Does the software application work as expected?".

%   \item \textbf{Maintenance:} In this phase, the software application is
%   maintained and updated to fix any bugs or issues that arise after the
%   application has been deployed. This phase answers the question, "How
%   can the software application be improved?".
% \end{itemize}

% \subsubsection{Agile Model}

% The \textbf{agile model} is an iterative and incremental approach to
% software development. It consists of several phases, including planning,
% design, coding, testing, and deployment. The agile model allows for
% flexibility and adaptability throughout the development process.

\section{Different Types of Application Development}

There are several different types of application development, including:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Web Development
  \item Mobile Application Development
  \item Desktop Application Development
  \item Game Development
  \item Cloud Development
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Web Development}

\textbf{Web development} is the process of creating websites and web
applications. It involves designing the user interface, writing code,
and testing the website for bugs. Web development can be divided into
two categories: front-end development and back-end development.

\subsubsection{Front-End Development}

\textbf{Front-end development} is the process of creating the user
interface of a website. It involves designing the layout, colors, and
fonts of the website. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
to create the user interface of a website.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{HTML (HyperText Markup Language)} is the standard markup
        language used to create web pages. It defines the structure of a web
        page using a series of elements.

  \item \textbf{CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)} is a style sheet language
        used to define the appearance of a web page. It allows developers to
        control the layout, colors, and fonts of a website.

  \item \textbf{JavaScript} is a programming language used to create
        interactive elements on a web page. It allows developers to add
        functionality such as animations, pop-ups, and form validation to a
        website.

  \item \textbf{Bootstrap} is a front-end framework that allows developers
        to create responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides a set of
        pre-designed components, such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars,
        that can be easily customized.

  \item \textbf{React} is a JavaScript library used to create user
        interfaces for single-page applications. It allows developers to build
        reusable components that update automatically when the data changes.

        quickly and efficiently. Ruby on Rails follows the convention over
        configuration principle, which allows developers to write less code
        and focus on building the application.

  \item \textbf{Laravel} is a web application framework for PHP. It
        provides a set of tools and libraries for building web applications
        quickly and efficiently. Laravel follows the model-view-controller
        (MVC) architecture, which allows developers to separate the business
        logic from the presentation layer.

  \item \textbf{Spring} is a web application framework for Java. It
        provides a set of tools and libraries for building enterprise-level
        web applications. Spring follows the inversion of control (IoC)
        principle, which allows developers to write loosely coupled code
        and focus on building the application.
\end{enumerate}

The above tools and technologies are commonly used in back-end development to
create the server-side logic of a website. Back-end developers use these tools
to interact with the database, process data, and handle user requests on the
server-side.

\chapter{Web Development}

\section{Introduction}

There are around 3.58 billion internet users on the planet. This implies that
over half of the world's 7.6 billion people have access to the internet, which
they use for everything from entertainment to education, communication to
commerce, keeping up with current events, and keeping up with business experts.
Indeed, for most people, the internet is the first (and often only) channel
through which we communicate with the world in all of its complexities.

There are three interactive elements on the internet:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Websites} - A collection of web pages that are linked
        together and share a common domain name.

  \item \textbf{Servers} - A computer or computer program that manages
        access to a centralized resource or service in a network.

  \item \textbf{Browsers} - A software application used to access and
        view websites on the internet.
\end{enumerate}

The frontend (client side) and the backend (server side) are two parts of any
website. The frontend comprises everything the user sees and experiences
instantly while visiting a website. The backend is behind the scenes that
store, send and receive information.

HTML, CSS, and Javascript files make up everything a user sees on a website. As
a web developer, these are the most basic tools needed. They are the languages
that required to build websites.

\section{HTML}

\textbf{HTML (HyperText Markup Language)} is the standard markup language
used to create web pages. It defines the structure of a web page using a
series of elements. It contains the essential elements of a website, such
as words, titles, and paragraphs, as well as links, images, and other
media. HTML elements are represented by tags, which are enclosed in angle
brackets. HTML forms the backbone of any webpage, dictating its structure
and content.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={HTML Example}, label={lst:html-example}]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>First Web Page</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
</body>

</html>
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:html-example} shows an example of an HTML document. An HTML
boilerplate usually looks like this:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{<!DOCTYPE html>} - Defines the document type and version
        of HTML. In this case, it is HTML5.
  \item \textbf{<html>} - Defines the root element of an HTML page.
  \item \textbf{<head>} - Contains meta-information about the document,
        such as the title, character set, and viewport.
  \item \textbf{<body>} - Contains the content of the document, such as
        headings, paragraphs, and images.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTML Tags}

HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. They are
enclosed in angle brackets and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
The opening tag is used to define the beginning of an element, while the
closing tag is used to define the end of an element.

When an HTML tag is opened, it must be closed to avoid errors. Some tags are
self-closing, meaning they do not require a closing tag. HTML tags can also
have attributes, which provide additional information about the element.

% Example of Open and Close Tag
\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={HTML Open and Close Tag}, label={lst:open-close-tag}]
<p>Welcome to my website.</p>
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:open-close-tag} shows an example of an HTML tag with an opening
tag (\textbf{<p>}) and a closing tag (\textbf{</p>}). The content of the
paragraph is "Welcome to my website.".

% Example of Self-Closing Tag
\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={HTML Self-Closing Tag}, label={lst:self-closing-tag}]
<img src="https://avatar.iran.liara.run/public" alt="Image" />
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:self-closing-tag} shows an example of an HTML tag that is
self-closing (\textbf{<img />}). This tag is used to insert an image into the
document. The \textbf{src} attribute specifies the URL of the image, while the
\textbf{alt} attribute provides a text description of the image.

\subsubsection{<html>...</html>}

This tag specifies that the webpage is written in HTML. It appears at the very
first and last line of the webpage. It is mainly used to show that the page
uses HTML5 – the latest version of the language. Also known as the root
element, this tag can be thought of as a parent tag for every other tag used in
the page.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={HTML <html> Tag}, label={lst:html-tag}]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</html>
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:html-tag} shows an example of the <html> tag. Here, the
\textbf{lang} attribute specifies the language of the document, which is
English in this case.

\subsubsection{<head>...</head>}

This tag is used to define the head section of the webpage. The head section
contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character set,
and viewport. It is not displayed on the webpage but is used to provide
information about the document to the browser and search engines.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={HTML <head> Tag}, label={lst:head-tag}]
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>First Web Page</title>
</head>
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:head-tag} shows an example of the <head> tag. Here, the
\textbf{<meta>} tag is used to define the character set and viewport of the
document, while the \textbf{<title>} tag is used to define the title of the
document. This title appears in the browser tab.

\subsubsection{<title>...</title>}

This tag is used to define the title of the document. It appears in the browser
tab and is used to identify the webpage.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={HTML <title> Tag}, label={lst:title-tag}]
<title>First Web Page</title>
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:title-tag} shows an example of the <title> tag. Here, the title
of the document is "First Web Page". This title appears in the browser tab when
the document is opened.

\subsubsection{<body>...</body>}

This tag is used to define the body section of the webpage. The body section
contains the content of the document, such as headings, paragraphs, and images.
It is displayed on the webpage and is visible to the user.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={HTML <body> Tag}, label={lst:body-tag}]
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website.</p>

\section{CSS}

\textbf{CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)} is a style sheet that describes how HTML
components appear on a page. CSS is used to manage your website's
appearance, style, and formatting, including RGB values, border colors,
background pictures, and more.

CSS files specify a set of rules for defining a set of properties and their
values.

\subsection{Core Concepts}

\subsubsection{Cascading and Specificity}

\paragraph{Cascading}

\textbf{Cascading} refers to the process of combining multiple style
sheets and resolving conflicts between them. When multiple style rules
apply to the same element, the browser uses a set of rules to determine
which styles to apply.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Specificity} - The more specific rule takes precedence.
  \item \textbf{Order} - The last rule defined takes precedence.
  \item \textbf{Importance} - The !important rule takes precedence.
\end{enumerate}

In CSS there are three types of style sheets:

\begin{enumerate}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Inline CSS}, label={lst:inline-style}]
  <p style="color: red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
  \end{lstlisting}

  \item \textbf{Inline Style} - The inline style is defined within
        the \textbf{style} attribute of an HTML element. It is used to define
        styles for a specific element.

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Internal CSS}, label={lst:internal-style}]
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>

  <h1>This is a heading.</h1>
  \end{lstlisting}

  \item \textbf{Internal Style Sheet} - The internal style sheet is
        defined within the \textbf{<style>} tag in the \textbf{<head>} section
        of the HTML document. It is used to define styles for a specific
        document.

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={External CSS}, label={lst:external-style}]
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  
  <h1>This is a heading.</h1>
  \end{lstlisting}

  \item \textbf{External Style Sheet} - The external style sheet is a
        separate file where you can define all the styles that you want to
        use on your website. You can link the external style sheet to your
        HTML document using the \textbf{<link>} tag.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Specificity}

\textbf{Specificity} is a set of rules that determines which style
rules apply to an element when multiple rules conflict. Specificity
is calculated based on the following factors:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Inline Styles} - Inline styles have the highest
        specificity and override all other styles.

  \item \textbf{Element Selectors} - Element selectors have the lowest
        specificity and are overridden by other selectors.

  \item \textbf{Class Selectors} - Class selectors have a higher
        specificity than element selectors.

  \item \textbf{ID Selectors} - ID selectors have a higher specificity
        than class selectors and element selectors.

  \item \textbf{!important} - The !important rule overrides all other
        rules and has the highest specificity.

  \item \textbf{Order of Appearance} - If two rules have the same
        specificity, the rule that appears last in the style sheet takes
        precedence.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Selectors}

In CSS, selectors are used to target HTML elements and apply styles to them.
There are different types of selectors that can be used to target elements
based on their type, class, ID, or other attributes.

\paragraph{Element Selector}

The element selector is used to target all elements of a specific type. It is
defined by the element name without any additional characters.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Element Selector}, label={lst:element-selector-html}]
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Element Selector CSS}, label={lst:element-selector-css}]
p {
  color: red;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:element-selector-html} and \ref{lst:element-selector-css} show an
example of the element selector. In this example, the \textbf{<p>} element is
targeted using the element selector, and the color of the text is set to red.

\paragraph{Class Selector}

The class selector is used to target elements with a specific class. It is
defined by a period (.) followed by the class name. This selector is useful
when you want to apply the same style to multiple elements. This is generally
the most common selector used in CSS.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Class Selector}, label={lst:class-selector-html}]
<p>This is a <span class="highlight">paragraph</span>.</p>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Class Selector CSS}, label={lst:class-selector-css}]
.highlight-text {
  background: yellow;
}

defined by a double colon (::) followed by the pseudo-element name.
Pseudo-elements are used to style elements based on their position or content.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Pseudo-element HTML}, label={lst:pseudo-element-html}]
<p>Velit sit ad aliquip laborum labore. Excepteur tempor ad duis Lorem. Aute labore dolor dolor aliqua eiusmod pariatur ut duis deserunt esse velit.</p>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Pseudo-element CSS}, label={lst:pseudo-element-css}]
p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
}

p::first-letter {
  font-size: 24px;
}

p::before {
  content: "Quote: ";
}

p::after {
  content: " - Author";
}
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{::first-letter}, \textbf{::before}, and \textbf{::after}, which style
the first line, first letter, and add content before and after the paragraph.

\subsubsection{The Box Model}

The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that defines how elements are
displayed on the page. It consists of four parts: content, padding, border, and
margin.

% TikZ Picture
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[dashed,fill=gray!10] (0, 0) rectangle (12, 8);
    \draw[fill=blue!20] (1, 1) rectangle (11, 7);
    \draw[dashed,fill=gray!10] (2, 2) rectangle (10, 6);
    \draw[dashed,fill=white] (3, 3) rectangle (9, 5);

    \node at (6, 4) {Content};
    \node at (6, 5.5) {Padding};
    \node at (6, 6.5) {Border};
    \node at (6, 7.5) {Margin};

    \node at (6, 8.5) {Top};
    \node at (13, 4) {Right};
    \node at (-1, 4) {Left};
    \node at (6, -0.5) {Bottom};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The Box Model}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Content} - The content area is where the text and images
        of the element are displayed. The content area is defined by the width
        and height of the element.

  \item \textbf{Padding} - The padding area is the space between the
        content area and the border of the element. Padding is used to create
        space around the content.

  \item \textbf{Border} - The border area is the line that surrounds the
        padding and content of the element. The border is used to define the
        visual appearance of the element.

  \item \textbf{Margin} - The margin area is the space outside the border
        of the element. The margin is used to create space between elements.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Units}

In CSS, there are different units that can be used to define the size of
elements. Some of the common units include:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Pixels (px)} - Pixels are a fixed unit of measurement
        that is used to define the size of elements in terms of screen pixels.
        Pixels are an absolute unit and do not change based on the screen size.

  \item \textbf{Percent (\%)} - Percentages are a relative unit of
        measurement that is used to define the size of elements as a percentage
        of the parent element. Percentages are relative to the parent element
        and change based on the size of the parent element.

  \item \textbf{Em (em)} - Em is a relative unit of measurement that is
        used to define the size of elements relative to the font size of the
        parent element. Em is relative to the font size of the parent element
        and changes based on the font size of the parent element.

  \item \textbf{Rem (rem)} - Rem is a relative unit of measurement that
        is used to define the size of elements relative to the font size of the
        root element (html). Rem is relative to the font size of the root element
        and does not change based on the font size of the parent element.

  \item \textbf{Viewport Width (vw)} - Viewport width is a relative unit
        of measurement that is used to define the size of elements relative to
        the width of the viewport. Viewport width is relative to the width of
        the viewport and changes based on the size of the viewport.

  \item \textbf{Viewport Height (vh)} - Viewport height is a relative unit
        of measurement that is used to define the size of elements relative to
        the height of the viewport. Viewport height is relative to the height of
        the viewport and changes based on the size of the viewport.

is activated. The active property can be used to change the color, background
color, or other styles of the element.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Active HTML}, label={lst:active-html}]
<button>Click Me</button>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Active CSS}, label={lst:active-css}]
button {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
}

button:active {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:active-html} and \ref{lst:active-css} show an example of the
\textbf{active} property. In this example, the background color of the
\textbf{<button>} element is changed to \textbf{lightcoral} when it is
activated.

\paragraph{Transition}

The \textbf{transition} property is used to create smooth transitions between
different styles of an element. The transition property can be set to a
specific duration, such as 0.5 seconds or 1 second, to create a smooth
transition effect.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Transition HTML}, label={lst:transition-html}]
<button>Hover Over Me</button>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Transition CSS}, label={lst:transition-css}]
button {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  transform: scale(1);
  transition: all 0.5s;
}

button:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:transition-html} and \ref{lst:transition-css} show an example of
the \textbf{transition} property. In this example, the background color of the
\textbf{<button>} element is changed to \textbf{lightcoral} and the scale is
increased when the mouse hovers over it, creating a smooth transition effect.

}

.blur {
  background-color: blue;
  filter: blur(5px);
}

.brightness {
  background-image: url('https://picsum.photos/200');
  filter: brightness(150%);
}

.contrast {
  background-color: red;
  filter: contrast(200%);
}

.grayscale {
  background-color: yellow;
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}

.hue-rotate {
  background-color: purple;
  filter: hue-rotate(90deg);
}

\subsubsection{Responsive Design}

\paragraph{Media Queries}

The \textbf{@media} rule is used to apply different styles for different media
types, such as screen sizes, devices, or orientations. Media queries can be
used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Media Queries HTML}, label={lst:media-queries-html}]
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
</div>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Media Queries CSS}, label={lst:media-queries-css}]
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: row;
  }

  .item {
    width: 50px;
  }
}

@media screen and (max-width: 400px) {
  .item {
    width: 25px;
  }
}

@media screen and (max-width: 200px) {
  .item {
    width: 10px;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:media-queries-html} and \ref{lst:media-queries-css} show an
example of media queries. In this example, the flex direction of the
\textbf{<div>} elements is changed to row when the screen width is less than
600 pixels, and the width of the elements is adjusted for different screen
sizes.

\paragraph{Responsive Images}

The \textbf{max-width} property is used to make images responsive by setting
the maximum width to 100\% of the container. This allows the image to scale
down proportionally to fit the container while maintaining its aspect ratio.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Responsive Images HTML}, label={lst:responsive-images-html}]
<div class="container">
  <img src="https://picsum.photos/400" alt="Placeholder Image" />
</div>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Responsive Images CSS}, label={lst:responsive-images-css}]
.container {
  max-width: 600px;
}

img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:responsive-images-html} and \ref{lst:responsive-images-css} show
an example of responsive images. In this example, the maximum width of the
image is set to 100\% of the container, allowing the image to scale down
proportionally to fit the container.
